## Running the Demos

### Prerequisites

* [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) - you need Visual Studio for Windows in order to compile and run WinForms projects. 

### TPFHello

* Navigate to `\demos\TPFHello`
* All the needed files are already included and referenced, so simply build the project (CTRL + SHIFT + B) to get it ready to run.

### John.SocialClub

* Navigate to `\demos\John.SocialClub` for the initial project, or to the `\demos\John.SocialClub.Converted` for the one that has been converted to RadControls.
* All the needed files are already included and referenced, so simply build the project (CTRL + SHIFT + B) to get it ready to run.

### DBApp

* Navigate to `\demos\DBApp`
* Connect to a DB engine. I am using LocalDB, but any DB will work. The table init script for Northwind is available here: `\demos\instnwnd.sql`
* A simple build is enough here as well.
